# Task-5-Exploratory-data-analysis-using-python
Performed exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). The analysis includes data summary, statistical insights, visualizations (pairplot, heatmap, histograms, boxplots, scatterplots), identification of trends and relationships, and a summary of key findings.

Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using **Python**.  
The goal is to extract insights, identify trends, and understand relationships between features using statistical and visual methods.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Source: [Seaborn Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) or CSV file.
- Includes passenger details such as age, fare, sex, class, survival status, etc.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€” Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€” Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€” Analysis and report

ðŸ“Š EDA Steps
1. **Data Summary**
   - `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`
2. **Visualizations**
   - Histograms, Boxplots, Scatterplots
   - `sns.pairplot()` and `sns.heatmap()`
3. **Trend Analysis**
   - Relationships between survival rate and features (Sex, Class, Fare, Age)
4. **Observations & Insights**
   - Written findings for each visual
5. **Summary of Findings**
   - Key insights and recommendations

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Women and children had a higher survival rate.
- First-class passengers had better survival chances.
- Fare is positively correlated with survival.
- Missing values exist for `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Deck`.
